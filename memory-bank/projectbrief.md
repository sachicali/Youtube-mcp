# YouTube Scraping MCP Server - Project Brief

## Project Overview
Building a production-ready Remote YouTube Scraping MCP Server that provides YouTube analytics, transcript extraction, channel analysis, and trend detection capabilities through the Model Context Protocol with real-time WebSocket support and multi-user authentication.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Features
1. **Transcript Gathering**: Extract transcripts from YouTube videos using YouTube Data API v3 captions
2. **Video Analytics**: Gather comprehensive video metrics and performance statistics
3. **Channel Analytics**: Analyze channel performance and video comparisons
4. **Comment Analysis**: Extract and analyze video comments for insights
5. **Search Capabilities**: Search videos by keywords and criteria
6. **Trending Analysis**: Monitor trending videos and topics
7. **Competitive Analysis**: Compare channels and performance metrics
